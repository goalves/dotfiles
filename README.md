# Dotfiles

Previously using:
- Alacritty
- Tmux
- Helix/VSCode (ew)

Currently using:
- Wezterm
- Zed
- Fish

Testing out how wezterm tabs/panes work in comparison to using tmux

## Setup

- Install GPGSuite
- Follow script on setup.sh
- Use stow to symlink .config files properly

## Tmux

If tmux plugins are not being installed for some reason, you should run:

```sh
~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins
```
