# Dotfiles

I like them.

I am currently using these for development:

- MacOS;
- Alacritty with tmux;
  - This uses lots of customized keys to behave like other terminals (overriding Ctrl+C with command/etc)
- Fish;
- VSCode;
- Vim (for writing commits/parsing files manually);

Each folder contains an application configuration, its installation is not described yet but should be done just
copying some things over :).

## Installation

TBD

## Tmux

If tmux plugins are not being installed for some reason, you should run:

```sh
~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins
```
