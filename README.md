# Dotfiles

This has more than dotfiles and actually sets up several other stuff.
I am currently using MacOS.

## MacOS setup

- Install Alacritty (other option would be to use Warp but its slow)
- Install GPGSuite
- Follow script on setup.sh

## Tmux

If tmux plugins are not being installed for some reason, you should run:

```sh
~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins
```
