# Dotfiles

These are STILL not updated but at least I have someting to resort to in case of despair.

Currently using MacOS, Wezterm, Fish, Starship, Zed.

## Setup

- Follow `setup.sh` to install base stuff
- Run `macos.sh` to setup MacOS related stuff (keyboard, menu bar, etc)

## Configuring Git

Private keys and references should live in the `.gitconfig.local` file as it is imported through the `.gitconfig` file.

There is an example of how to set it up for `GitHub`.
